            orthotics and mobility device provider in Papua New Guinea. NOPS operates under the Health Facilities
            Standards Branch (HFSB) of the National Department of Health (NDOH) and respective Provincial Health
            Authorities to provide prosthetic, orthotic, wheelchair, walking aid and self-care assistive technology (AT)
            services (hereafter referred to as NOPS assistive technology services) to people throughout Papua New
            Guinea.</p>
            <p>There are seven NOPS facilities throughout Papua New Guinea. There isone each located in the National Capital
            District, East New Britain Province, East Sepik Province, Milne Bay Province, Morobe Province, Simbu Province and  Western Highlands Province. Each centre
            provides in-clinic and community outreach services. Additionally, NOPS holds close relationships with two church-based organisations delivering

            Province.
